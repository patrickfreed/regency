World generation steps:
1. Use noise to generate tiles - elevation, material, etc. ACTUAL GENERATION HERE
    - TODO: abstract world generation properties
2. Use connected component labelling to discover components
	- continents
	- islands
	- oceans
3. Identify categories within components (ccl over similarity index)
	- forests
	- plains
	- deserts
	- mountains
4. run rivers (????)
================ TBD ===================
5a. generate history
	- choose settlements of antiquity
	- simulate
5b. choose settlements, generate relationships, generate populations

game design:

start: start as single actor
  - starting member of your faction, but can leave,die, etc
main game: can live as loner minecraft style (need to make this difficult)
           alternatively, can travel and recruit followers into faction (M&B style)
              - each actor has distinct personality traits that dictate what they do / how they interpret orders
              - orders: fun aspect of game will be autonomy of members of your faction, but you need to be able to
                        control your people to some extent. need to find line here.
end goal: prosperity for your faction / not dying (DF style). Alternatively, becoming regent of entire
          known world (M&B).

gameplay: you control a faction of actors. You can issue direct commands to them and they will obey as if the orders
          were their own ideas (you merely provide inspiration). issuing orders that contradict incentives may cause mental
          issues among actors (idea).

          the "game" here is providing what is essentially "divine inspiration" to the your followers. ideally, you will
          become somewhat familiar with their "personalities", and getting them to cooperate and achieve is the primary
          challenge. hopefully the ai will be advanced enough to do goofy stuff and act in unpredictable/complex ways.

          I hope to be able to define loose objective/action/goals and let randomness and ai interactions define the rest.
          Not sure how going to implement social interaction and all its complexities...
