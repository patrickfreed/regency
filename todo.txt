World generation steps:
1. Use noise to generate tiles - elevation, material, etc. ACTUAL GENERATION HERE
    - TODO: abstract world generation properties
2. Use connected component labelling to discover components
	- continents
	- islands
	- oceans
3. Identify categories within components (ccl over similarity index)
	- forests
	- plains
	- deserts
	- mountains
4. run rivers (????)
================ TBD ===================
5a. generate history
	- choose settlements of antiquity
	- simulate
5b. choose settlements, generate relationships, generate populations
